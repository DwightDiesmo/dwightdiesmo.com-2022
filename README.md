This website was created using HUGO as a static site generator. 

If you'd like to recreate this, I would recommend installing HUGO since pulling data, generating new pages, and adding new content becomes a much simpler process. 

First, create a git repository. I've named mine with the domain that I have. But if you'd like to use GitHub, then one method is to name your repository username.github.io. I think it has to be a public repo...

Clone your repository onto your computer.

Add an index.html file, static folder (images), styles folder (css).
That's pretty much good for now. 

Then write the html code for your site. I would recommend using a modern UI framework like Bootstrap, Material UI, Bulma, etc.

Then commit and push your changes onto GitHub.
